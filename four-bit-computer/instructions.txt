; Instructions for my 4-bit Computer
; At max it can hold 16 instructions, each 4 bit wide
; First 3 bits starting from MSB is used for opcode
; The LSB is used as data bit
; Our CPU contains only one register (register_A), which is an accumulator
; Which accumulates value

LOAD 1  ; loads 1 into accumulator (register A)
ADD 1   ; adds 1 to accumulator and stores it in accumulator (2 is the value of the accumulator now)
JMP 1   ; jumps to address 1



; Implementing labels in my assembly

; JMP TEST_1

; TEST_1:
;    LOAD 1
;    ADD 1
;    JMP 1
