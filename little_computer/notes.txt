Components of LC-3 (Notes taken from Claude)
------------------

Registers

    8 General-Purpose Registers (R0-R7)

    Used for temporary data storage
    Can hold 16-bit values


    Program Counter (PC)

    Stores the address of the next instruction to be executed


    Condition Code Registers (CCR)

    N (Negative) Flag
    Z (Zero) Flag
    P (Positive) Flag


    Instruction Register (IR)

    Holds the current instruction being executed




Memory

    16-bit word size
    16-bit addressing
    Supports 2^16 = 65,536 memory locations
    Typically divided into:

    User program space
    Operating system space
    Memory-mapped I/O




Instruction Set

    15 total instructions
    Key instructions include:

    ADD (addition)
    AND (bitwise AND)
    NOT (bitwise NOT)
    LD (Load)
    ST (Store)
    BR (Branch)
    JMP (Jump)
    JSR (Jump to Subroutine)




Addressing Modes

    Immediate
    Register
    Direct
    Indirect
    Base + Offset


Datapath Components

    ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)

    Performs arithmetic and logical operations


    Multiplexers

    Route data between different components


    Sign Extenders

    Convert smaller bit-width values to 16-bit




Control Unit

    Manages instruction fetch-decode-execute cycle
    Generates control signals
    Coordinates between different components


Input/Output

    Memory-mapped I/O
    Supports basic input and output operations


Interrupt Handling

    Basic interrupt mechanism
    Can handle system-level interrupts


Instruction Cycle

    Fetch Stage

    Get instruction from memory using PC


    Decode Stage

    Interpret the instruction


    Execute Stage

    Perform the instruction's operation
