# Page based addressing scheme

A "page based addressing scheme" is a memory management technique where a physical memory is divided into `fixed-size` blocks called `pages`, and each page is assigned a unique number, allowing the system to access any memory location by specifying the page number instead of a direct physical address.

# Example
Let's say we are building a 3-bit CPU and we are working on constructing a data memory for it. We have decided to create a data memory which is `8-bit` wide and have `16 data memory location`.
