# Grammar for my Assembler

This helps with parsing the tokens generated by the lexer.

## Actual Grammar

```
<instruction> ::= <mnemonic> <operand>

<mnemonic> ::= "LOAD" | "ADD" | "SUB" | "STORE"

<operand> ::= any numbers ranging from 0 to 9
```

## Example Instruction
```

LOAD 1
ADD 1
SUB 1
STORE 0
```
